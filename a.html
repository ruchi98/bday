			<h2>Days at school, class VII</h2>
			<p class="quote">Well well well, a very tiring day indeed. Atleast school days were going fine but then Neena ma'am comes up with a solution to put an end to the chatty groups of our class. Any guesses ehh? </p>

			<p> Well yes guessed right, It's the same old so called punishment of fixing seats! Ahh, atleast there was something new this time and rather than the teachers eyeing for a girl boy pair, we depended on a disctinct roll no. pattern for fixing seats<br>
		<br>

		So who's it gonna be.<br>
		Hope it's Shaloni..<br>
		Fine, let's see...Brace urself!<br>

		<br> Ahaa...so it's none other than the boy who's quite intelligent liked by teachers especially Neena ma'am ...but did  I ever had a conversation?..ah..ahh..ahh can't remember..wait yes!he was given the duty to ensure nobody talks..and he came to me and shaloni and uttered these gem of words "Overreact mat kar", ahh..I was startled by the display of such politeness..yes yes, the guy's the same..
		</p>
		<p>also as far as my memory favours me, occasionally he used to tease like callin "Ruchi.." then me turning back just to get a reply "Ruchi bus aa gyi.."...(P.S. Time Travel to 2019: Also considering the past record startin from class 7th( I would really really like to take my back what I said about me liking ur jokes) </p>

			<h2>How's the partner?</h2>
			<p class="quote">o the boy seems fine but not very welcoming. Koi bat nhi chlo dekte hai. Then, bell rings, next is going to be eng period and we had to bring eng practice books and we need pencils! None of us has.. I call Devika to lend an extra pencil..luckily she has..but then pencil is one and peeps eyeing for it is two..</p>

			<p>so she plays that little game of throwin the pencil and whosoever catches..gets it..but then the series of snatching starts..such display of polite behaviour part 2.. and the hell this guy becomes so competitive....hah..I give in..snatchin just ends up to Bindu ma'am sayin" Ruchi..! I didn't expect it from u"..and tearin one pg of the textbook. So I pretend to be sad about it arranging gluesticks..n he's like"pkka, ye abhi fata h?' nalayak ekdum :P<br>

	<h2>Ahh..he knows POP CULTURE!</h2>
	<p class="quote">I guess he knows about many many things...he can talk on a range of topics...but he doesn't like my crush, Enrique ..plus he's a die hard fan of eminem..he likes rappin(how the hell he learns all those lyrics is a mystery..) Chatting with divya, rashi, shaloni...on how dispappointing the classes were because of fixed seats...and we all agreeing..Divya was like"Rehne de, tum dono toh pure time bat krte rehte ho..tu yaha dekti bhi nhi". Ahh we talk..but bezati hi krne k attempts hote they..</p>

	<p>Then the series of suggesting a song starts just to hear how bad was ur suggestion...'why not me'(TIME TRAVEL: I don't like that song too, seriously rota h faltu mei) suggest kia tha first song to listen to only to hear the next day ki "Enrique toh ro rha tha gaane mei like always".. <br

			<h2>Another time!</h2>
			<p class="quote">Seats got changed again..Nidhi ma'am was irritated with him cuz he supposedly talked a lot, so again he's the partner! He's fun..loves avnegers..even reciting dialogues in a flow with so much passion..the n hulk said "sry can't remember", bas last scene thing it was. Epic scene hua aaj...Arpit as always showing tantrums seat change k liye..I wanted to sit with Bhavya, n he was to sit with Amritesh..but then Arpit doesn't listen..me n bhavya doing the talking..then bhavya all irritated..then I am like kyu nhi krna seat change..Bhavya intervenin "Vo seat change nhinkar rha kyuki tu yaha par baithi hai"..whoah whoah climax..phir to prove it wrong lightning speed se hoti h Arpit ki seat change..</p>
