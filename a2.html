	<h2>Dear Chico,</h2>

	<p class="quote"> Did u fall for that hideous bye link thing? I guess u didn't or did ya? :P So that sleepin msg of mine was a trap.. I am not..busy doing this thing..it's not that special..no js or effects..I wanted to but only this has to suffice as of now...going on, so here's u turning 21! WHOAHH! A grown up man...finally! (who's hell scared of the faulty lift video but fine :p)<br>
<br>
<P>I don't know know how but yup, I can see u do care...it's there..it was there also..but I wasn't able to see it my bad. You are simply such a person right now who I feel could do like anything he wants. You are damn creative, damn stupid(haha..unexpected ryt :P, but 2 tareefe sath nhi), damn intelligent, damn caring(2 tareefe vla, joke it was) and a simple person who doesn't care how his hair is, loves t-shirts like hell(which I hate), eats classic cheese burger with ganne ka juice..(Jhalwa k jalwa ka asar I guess).</P>


<br> I really don't know how things led to this and how they will go about in future, but I am sure you will simply have things your way cuz u deserve it very well. Don't stress out over petty things, just see how far u've come (8.4 se 9.7, khatarnaak!)..not just in gpa, but as personality u have grown, I wish u do more in the future as well.</p>
<p> I won't say those lines lines of me being lucky to have you by my side or anything cuz I am a robot, u said so (ye bhi joke tha, darna mat :P). Proving I am not a robot (at writing atleast), you are a heck of a person I am proud to have known, it's just that feeling that you will be there, n trust me, it's a fine feeling. Listening to those daily dramas and mood swings of mine, it would be irritating but kya kre, aate hi itte fluctuations hai zindagi mei, just listening and the suggestions are good enough..</p>
<p> Now my brain has almost stopped working , 4:52 am it is. I just want to say thank you for everything, and don't be dubious about your capabilities, your family trusts you, your friends do, and I do. You will bring happiness to many, just stay focused like you are. And you speak wonderful Oriya, much better than what atleast I expected, and I found that speech of urs very cute, mayb it's just  the language, the kich auchi words..ok..ok...not exactly..jokin..fine! So wish you all the best. Hope you have an awesome year ahead and you have all the luck and good by your side!
